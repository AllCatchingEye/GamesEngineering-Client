# Schafkopf UE5 Client

## Project setup

In order to develop the UE5 client of Schafkopf, a few components need to be installed first:
1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) as source control software.
2. [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) to handles large files.  
    Once the plugin is installed, execute `git lfs install` to setup Git LFS.
3. Unreal Engine 5.3.1 via the Epic Games Launcher.

## Style and coding conventions

Unreal Engine 5 has its own style and coding conventions, to which we too shall adhere to.
Strictly, as if it were the law. The following sources give an overview of the Unreal Engine's
style and coding conventions and project structure:
