# Schafkopf UE5 Client

## Project setup

In order to develop the UE5 client of Schafkopf, a few components need to be installed first:
1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) as source control software.
2. [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) to handles large files.  
    Once the plugin is installed, execute `git lfs install` to setup Git LFS.
3. Unreal Engine 5.3.1 via the Epic Games Launcher.
